CryptoPIX is a game focussing on creating pixel art together. Every day new creations can be made to win a decentralized voting round!

Collaborate to create art or make a statement. All contributors of winning submissions receive a pro rata share of the won tokens, which can be sold for real money or used to paint faster in the game.
