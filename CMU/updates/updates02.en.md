Dear community followers,

*Let’s recap on what was going on in Cryptomeeup recently and what is coming next!*

## Technical Development
**2nd round game testing**

We launched our 2nd round of game testing last Sunday, adding a dynamic countdown timer associated with a big prize pool. This round of testing is still running. Check our previous medium post for details and participate to win to the final pool!

**New payment method**

We optimized the scatter plugin backward compatibility and support mobile EOS wallet to play. Currently, you can play the Cryptomeetup via Scatter Desktop, Scatter plugin,[Math Wallet](http://www.mathwallet.org/cn/), [Token Pocket](https://www.mytokenpocket.vip/en/), [Meet.One](https://meet.one/)

**New Feature — Token Page**

As announced earlier, the EOS celebrity Token holders shares 3000 CMU airdrops proportionally, and the regional manager (last land token holders) in the Cryptomeetup alpha test shares 2000 CMU airdrops proportional. We already distributed these CMU tokens to above accounts and users can claim at the token page.

In addition, we added a stake function. Users can stake CMU to be the share holder to get the project dividend. The dividend will distribute when the testing round ends.

## What’s coming next?
The developer team are busily developing the Map mode, which will support location-based services, such as check-in, LBS message, EOS store, and etc.
